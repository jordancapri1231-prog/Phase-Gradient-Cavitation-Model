# Phase-Gradient-Cavitation-Model
This repository contains the public release of the Phase-Gradient Cavitation Model. The model is constructed using conventional mathematical tools (fluid analogy, divergence, gradient behavior, and phase-differential structures), and organized using conceptual clarity inspired by the Contextual Premise Framework (CPF).
